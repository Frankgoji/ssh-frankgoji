sshf is an interface that uses regex matching, allowing for shortcuts when
typing in commands. This allows you to specify the host and the server with a
minimum of typing. Furthermore, it allows you to easily specify different
server/hostname combinations without requiring a configuration to specify each
one (e.g. to switch from the hive1 server to hive21). This interface preserves
the arguments that can be used with ssh.
